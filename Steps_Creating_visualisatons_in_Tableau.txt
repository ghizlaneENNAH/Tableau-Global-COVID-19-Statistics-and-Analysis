Steps to Create Tableau Public Dashboard and Upload to GitHub
Download Tableau Public:

If you don’t have Tableau Public installed, download it here.

Execute SQL Queries:

The SQL queries are located in the file SQL_Queries_Covid19.

Execute the first query, then save the result in an Excel file as tableau_table1.xlsx.

Execute the second query, then save the result in an Excel file as tableau_table2.xlsx.

Execute the third query, then save the result in an Excel file as tableau_table3.xlsx.

Execute the fourth query, then save the result in an Excel file as tableau_table4.xlsx.

Data Cleaning:

For Query 3, ensure that any NULL values in HighestInfectionCount and PercentPopulationInfected are replaced with 0.

For Query 4, ensure that the date column is in short date format and replace any NULL values with 0.

Import Data into Tableau:

Open Tableau Public.

Click "Microsoft Excel" to import the Excel files (tableau_table1.xlsx, tableau_table2.xlsx, tableau_table3.xlsx, tableau_table4.xlsx) as data sources.

Create Visualizations:

First Visualization (Global Numbers):

Drag DeathPercentage, TotalCases, and TotalDeaths to the columns.

Choose Table as the visualization type.

Adjust the marks and format to display the values as needed.

Format percentages to display as integers (e.g., 2%).

Second Visualization (Location-wise Deaths):

Drag Location to columns and SUM(Death) to rows.

Sort by total deaths.

Rename Location to Continent.

Use the Marks section to customize the chart's appearance.

Third Visualization (Map):

Click on Location and assign Geographical Role → Country/Region.

Drag Longitude to columns and Latitude to rows.

Choose Map chart and drag Location and PercentPeopleAffected to the Marks section.

Customize the map using Tableau’s map settings.

Update the legend title to Percent Population Infected.

Fourth Visualization (Time Series):

Drag Date to columns and PercentPopulationInfected to rows.

Filter the data by month.

Add specific locations (countries) to the visualization and use Max for the percent.

Apply Forecasting from the Analysis menu for predictive analysis.

Dashboard:

Create a new dashboard in Tableau.

Set the size to Automatic to adjust to different screen sizes.

Add all visualizations to the dashboard.
